(*
	Creates new directories inside of the Capture directory and sets the capture directory.

	When running the script you'll be prompted for a new directory name. The prompt
	will repeat allowing going back to FileMaker or a spreadsheet, enter an empty string
	to end the loop.

	New directories are created adjacent to the current capture directory, _unless_
	the capture directory is "Capture", in which case new folders are made inside.

	Set `repeatPrompt` to `false` to only prompt for one name.

	If `setCaptureFolder` is `true` then the capture directory will be
	set to the *first* directory name entered.
	
	Set `resetCaptureCounter` to `true` to set the capture counter to 1 when making a new folder.
